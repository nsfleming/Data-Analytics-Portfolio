I have created a website for my portfolio, To access this please select portfolio to open it. 
Please let me know if it does not function for you, I can provide you with a video of my E-Portfolio. 

I wanted to do more for this assignment but I did run out of time. I hope that you do like this as I put more time into this than anything else in this program. 
Have an amazing time at Conestoga, they will be so lcuky to have you as a Teacher. 

Cheers,
