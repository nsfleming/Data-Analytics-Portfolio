                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>As a recent graduate with a background in Economics and Mathematics, I possess the skills and
                        qualifications necessary to succeed in the field of data analytics. My proficiency in business
                        intelligence tools such as Cognos Analytics, PowerBI, and Tableau, as well as programming
                        languages like R, Python, and JavaScript, demonstrate my ability to work with data and present
                        it in a visually compelling way.</p>
                    <p>My experience in ETL processes using SQL and MS Access, data visualization and communication, and
                        database management has honed my skills in this field. Additionally, my participation in the
                        HEAD Data Competition has given me exposure to working on data projects and using tools such as
                        SPSS Modeler, Python, and SQL to clean and scrub data for modeling use. Overall, I have a strong
                        foundation for a career in data analytics and am excited to continue to develop my skills and
                        knowledge in this field.</p>
                    <p>
                        Some of my interests include learning new languages, small art projects and cataloguing all my
                        books. I am currently learning Japanese on Duolingo and have been going for almost a year.

                                <p class="card-text">
                                    The project assessed the lack of flexibility in public transit services provided to
                                    persons with disabilities in the City of Hamilton. At the time, the door-to-door
                                    service provided by a contractor was limited to subscribed trips for recurring
                                    medical appointments or other activities, and casual trips that were reserved seven
                                    days in advance. The city was interested in exploring opportunities to improve the
                                    overall customer experience for clients using the accessible transportation services
                                    (ATS).
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    The project aimed to convert trip data from ATS into useful information that could
                                    provide insights into the service. The project explored the potential to offer more
                                    flexibility to persons with disabilities by identifying areas for improvement. The
                                    insights generated from the data helped to address key needs such as understanding
                                    the patterns of trips made by clients, the major trip destinations, trips by ward,
                                    inter-regional trips, volume by time and day, and the impact of the future Light
                                    Rail Transit Corridor.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    Additionally, the project assessed the opportunities to bring rural clients to the
                                    urban transit boundary and onto conventional HSR transportation, and the possibility
                                    of creating community bussing in some areas.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                    The reasons why the project needed to be carried out were due to the city's
                                    commitment to improving the overall customer experience for clients using public
                                    transit. The city recognized the importance of providing accessible transportation
                                    services to persons with disabilities and the need to ensure that the service was
                                    flexible, efficient, and met the needs of its clients. The city also recognized the
                                    potential benefits that the conversion of trip data into useful information could
                                    have on improving the service.

                                    This is an EDA of Pokemon statistics, which involves the analysis of a dataset
                                    containing information on 721 unique Pokemon from the first generation Kanto Region
                                    to the 6th generation Kalos Region Pokemon X and Y. The dataset includes various
                                    fields such as ID, Name, Type 1, Type 2, Total, HP, Attack, Defense, SP Atk, SP Def,
                                    Speed, Generation, and Legendary. The objective of the analysis is to identify which
                                    features have an impact on a Pokemon's Total stats. The first step involves
                                    importing the required libraries and reading the data into R. The custom color
                                    palette is defined for the Pokemon types to facilitate data visualization. The
                                    dataset is then explored, and the variables and data types are identified using
                                    various R functions. Summary statistics of the dataset are also checked.</p>

                                I possess a high level of proficiency when it comes to using IBM SPSS Modeler for data
                                analytics. With my expertise, I can effortlessly handle large and complex data sets, and

                                machine learning algorithms to uncover hidden patterns and trends. I have a solid
                                understanding of data mining concepts and statistical modeling techniques, and can apply
                                these principles to solve complex business problems. Whether it's performing data
                                exploration, creating predictive models, or building custom machine learning workflows,
                                I'm

                                outcomes for any project. I'm always eager to learn and expand my skills in this area,
                                as I
                                believe that staying at the forefront of technological advancements is key to success in
